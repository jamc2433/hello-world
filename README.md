# hello-world
Hi fellow collaborators.  I am just learning to code and collaborate on github.  I recently discovered Anacoda, so I finally have a way to load files and packages consistently.
If you have any advice for a noobie such as myself, please let me know. Python books do very little to help one understand how to integrate and manipulate code for real world implementation.
Thanks, Jake
